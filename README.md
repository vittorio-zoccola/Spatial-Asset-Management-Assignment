# Spatial-Asset-Management

This project involves the design and implementation of a spatial database for asset management, encompassing the selection and declaration of a location-based topic, creation of a three-level spatial pyramid with nested assets, formulation of seven decisions with a focus on practical applications, development of SQL scripts for table creation, constraints, and data insertion, along with the generation of visualization using QGIS and 3D visualization with FME, demonstrating hands-on expertise in spatial data management principles and database design.
